title: The P62 Keyboard Layout

I think my original motivation for this layout came from the idea of cramming all of my favorite keys into a [1170 Pelican Case](https://amzn.to/2OXAcbm) because CyberDecks are rad, and I still want to [build one eventually](https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit). As I was exploring, I completely fell in love with this little layout that I dub P62.

My most comfortable keyboard layout is the 65%. I've moved on from TKL to save space, and the idea of making a layout that's as functional to me as the 65% but even more compact than 60% is quite appealing. Here are some of the design decisions:

- Try to preserve as much of the original key locations and stagger as possible - especially the arrow keys. This should be an easy layout to switch from the 65% and back.
- Minimize width, but we're not aiming for 40% here.
- Prioritize left mods over those on the right.
- Trade off against the size of the mod keys. I'm hoping the locations will still feel natural despite the size reduction.

Admittedly, a lot of these decisions are very much a personal preference. This layout is highly unlikely to be popular - it introduces keycap sizes that are not common for their respective rows and legends, so getting keycaps for this beyond the uniform close to is probably impossible. I still think the compact size is attractive - a full keyboard with this layout (including the gap) would take exactly as much space as a TKL(!).

It will probably take me a while to actually build a CyberDeck, but I'd like to try this layout even standalone. Time to hand-wire my first keyboard - wish me luck!
