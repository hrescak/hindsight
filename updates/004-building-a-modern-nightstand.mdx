title: Building a Modern Nightstand

This is a beginner-friendly woodworking guide for building a simple modern nightstand that is [much narrower than usual](/updates/002-finding-a-narrow-nightstand). It's limited to basic tools and materials, and it doesn't break the bank.

## Instructions

There is a decision to be made before You start and that is whether you want to _build a back side of the nightstand or not_. I did because I wanted to hide the cables and the back of a drawer more but it's not strictly necessary and it will save us some material and cuts.

### Preparing the panels

Let's get started on our table or circular saw and take all of our main and drawer panels to rough and final size. As always, trying to cut panels of the same width at once is great idea - and an easy way to ensure the panels (especially our middle ones) are all the same width.

We'll be cutting rabeds on the drawer sides and drawer end to acommodate the drawer floor. The width of the rabeds should be the width of the bottom material (I recommend 1/8in over 1/4in). If you are using the 1/8in panel for the back of the nightstand, cut rabeds on the inside back of the body sides and top.

Next we'll drill the pocket holes. Double check you're drilling them on the same side to save yourself some wood filler.

Cut grommet holes.
