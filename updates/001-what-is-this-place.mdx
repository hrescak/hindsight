Hey, I'm [Matej](https://hrescak.com). Hindsight supply my tinkering spot. It's going ot be mostly
about mechanical keyboards and woodworking, but I'm letting my interest meander,
and I love to learn new stuff. We'll see!

Two things happened at the beginning of 2020. We moved into a house with a garage, and we were (for obvious reasons) stuck at home. I also found myself spending late evenings in the depths of woodworking YouTube. It wasn't long before I followed up with tool purchases and started building things.

Later in the year, the weather turned too cold to work in the unheated garage, so I found a new rabbit hole — mechanical keyboards. I furnished a basement room with more workspace, bought a 3D printer, soldering iron, and lots of tiny keyboard parts.

So far, I'm thoroughly enjoying learning new things as I build, and I'm hoping to share this with my future self, friends, and anyone willing to take a peek.

✌️, Matej
