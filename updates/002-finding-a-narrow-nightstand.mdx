title: Finding a Narrow Nightstand

It's not easy! Seeing the bedroom in our new house, it was immediately clear where the bed would go. The room is symmetrical, and we'd be getting eye twitches if the bed wasn't in that particular spot. It had only one catch. The headboard wall would not be wide enough to support a king-size bed and regular-sized nightstands.
 
Not willing to compromise on bed size (I'm a starfish sleeper), I spent good two weeks looking for a nightstand. At under 13 inches wide, the pickings were particularly slim, so I quickly decided this would be my first woodworking project. A couple of constraints immediately stood out:

- **Basic tools and materials only** - I was still deciding on whether to get a table saw at that point.
- **Ample storage** - We read a couple of books at a time, and a lot of nightstands are practically just a plank.
- **"Fenced" top** - If I had a penny for each time I accidentally swiped my phone off the nightstand at night, I'd have a good couple of bucks

After a handful of iterations, the design was set — Made of white oak plywood, 12 inches wide, with hairpin legs. There's a fenced surface at the top for a phone, light, and one book. Underneath that is one open shelf for more books and one closed drawer at the bottom for everything else.

I used basic pocket hole joinery for the carcass, rabbet joints for the drawer and finished everything with a coat of poly. The only exception is the drawer front, for which I used a combination primer/paint spray and matte spray varnish.

We've been using these for the last year or so, and we're super happy overall. If I were to make a new version, I'd probably do some things differently:

- Incorporate a wireless phone charger. Having to fish for the cable is still a chore.
- Replace the hairpin legs. They give the build a sense of lightness, but wooden legs can probably achieve the same.
- Get higher quality drawer hardware. It still requires a bit of force to open the drawer despite tuning the slides.

Thanks for following along. I'll likely follow up with a build guide in case people get interested.
